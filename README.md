 How to play: 
 You will get 2 scripts on your desk, each one having a few aspects:
 * Title: This is a randomly generated title, fun to read but does not affect the game overall
 * Genres: these can range from Biopic to Thriller, and are what the title generation is based on.
 * Namesake Actors: These are the people that are being talked about and will get people to go see the movie.
 * Zhuzh: This is the aspect that makes the film different than other films of the time, is it a musical? is it a reboot? All things that affect the public's view on the movie

Once you select one of the two scripts, they both go away and the one you selected will be at the box office for at least 4 weeks, you do have an option to keep it there for another 4 weeks, which could earn you more money, but a likely chance as well to lose money.

Along with the scripts on your desk, there is a phone, this has 3 social media posts talking about what people are interested in. Try to match those when putting scripts out.

That's about it, good luck to you and have fun!
